    There are many different ways to organize a paragraph. The organization you choose will depend on the controlling idea of the paragraph. Below are a few possibilities for organization, with links to brief examples:




        Narration: Tell a story. Go chronologically, from start to finish. (See an example.)
        Description: Provide specific details about what something looks, smells, tastes, sounds, or feels like. Organize spatially, in order of appearance, or by topic. (See an example.)   
    </pre>

    <p>C + O<sub>2</sub> = CO<sub>2</sub></p>

    <!-- &rarr; is used for html arrow...we can use diferernt arrows by html entity online -->
    <p>C + O<sub>2</sub> &rarr; CO<sub>2</sub></p>
